# RU-BuSMS
Completed Project at 2019 Fall HackRU

This project was created to help Rutgers students navigate the bus system.
As a freshman, learning the bus system was overwhelming so our text-based service eases the transition to college.

Text-based service that takes the input of any two building names in Rutgers and departure time
Returns nearest Rutgers bus stop and identifies which bus to take at the current or inputed time
Built using: Python, Flask, Google Maps API, Twilio API
